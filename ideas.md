**Design Movement:** Organic Modernism with Sensual Fluidity

**Core Principles:**
- Embrace natural curves and flowing forms that mirror the human body
- Create intimate, inviting spaces through layered depth and soft boundaries
- Balance sophistication with approachability through refined organic elements
- Celebrate pleasure-positive aesthetics without clinical sterility

**Color Philosophy:**
The palette draws from natural skin tones and intimate moments—soft peach (#FFD4C4) as the primary warmth, deep navy (#1A2B4A) for grounding sophistication, and mint teal (#7FCDCD) as an energizing accent. These colors evoke dawn light on skin, the depth of connection, and the freshness of new experiences. The emotional intent is to create a safe, warm environment that feels both sensual and trustworthy.

**Layout Paradigm:**
Asymmetric flowing sections with organic dividers—use curved SVG separators between sections, offset content blocks that create visual rhythm, and floating card elements with soft shadows. Avoid rigid grids; instead, create breathing layouts where content flows like conversation.

**Signature Elements:**
- Fluid blob shapes and curved section dividers that suggest organic forms
- Soft gradient overlays on images (peach-to-transparent, teal-to-navy)
- Rounded, pill-shaped buttons with subtle hover animations that expand
- Abstract line art illustrations suggesting intimacy and connection

**Interaction Philosophy:**
Interactions should feel gentle and responsive—smooth transitions that ease rather than snap, hover states that bloom outward, scroll-triggered animations that reveal content like unwrapping a gift. Every click should feel intentional and rewarding.

**Animation:**
Use spring-based animations with natural easing (cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)) for playful bounce on interactive elements. Implement scroll-triggered fade-ins with slight upward motion (20px). Calculator results should animate in with a gentle scale effect (0.95 to 1). Page transitions use crossfade with 300ms duration.

**Typography System:**
- Display: Playfair Display (serif, 700 weight) for headlines—elegant, sensual curves
- Body: DM Sans (sans-serif, 400/500 weights) for readability and modern clarity
- Hierarchy: 3.5rem/2.5rem/1.5rem/1rem with 1.6 line-height for body text
- This pairing balances romantic elegance with contemporary accessibility

**Design Movement:** Neo-Brutalism with Playful Confidence

**Core Principles:**
- Bold, unapologetic design that challenges sexual shame through visual confidence
- Raw, honest aesthetics that strip away pretense
- High contrast and strong boundaries that communicate clarity and consent
- Playful rebellion against sterile medical or overly romantic approaches

**Color Philosophy:**
Electric coral (#FF6B6B) as the primary punch—vibrant, alive, impossible to ignore. Paired with deep charcoal (#2D3142) for serious grounding and bright cyan (#4ECDC4) for energetic highlights. This palette screams confidence and joy. The emotional intent is empowerment: "Your pleasure matters, and we're not whispering about it."

**Layout Paradigm:**
Brutalist grid with intentional breaks—thick borders (4-6px), prominent shadows (8px offset, no blur), content blocks that overlap and collide. Use a strong 12-column grid but deliberately break it with full-bleed sections and offset elements. Text blocks sit in bold containers with visible structure.

**Signature Elements:**
- Thick, visible borders on all cards and buttons (4px solid)
- Harsh drop shadows (8px 8px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)) for depth without softness
- Bold geometric shapes (circles, squares, triangles) as decorative elements
- High-contrast typography with tight tracking on headlines

**Interaction Philosophy:**
Interactions should be immediate and satisfying—no easing, just instant state changes. Buttons push down on click (2px transform), hover states change background color completely, active states are unmistakable. Every interaction confirms "Yes, you did that."

**Animation:**
Minimal, purposeful motion—instant color changes, sharp 150ms transitions with linear easing. Calculators reveal results with a hard cut (no fade). Scroll animations are disabled except for sticky navigation. Loading states use bold geometric spinners, not subtle fades.

**Typography System:**
- Display: Space Grotesk (sans-serif, 700/800 weights) for headlines—geometric, bold, modern
- Body: Inter (sans-serif, 400/600 weights) for clarity and web-optimized readability
- Hierarchy: 4rem/2.25rem/1.25rem/1rem with 1.5 line-height, tight letter-spacing (-0.02em) on headlines
- This pairing creates strong hierarchy while maintaining brutal clarity

**Design Movement:** Soft Maximalism with Layered Intimacy

**Core Principles:**
- Rich, layered experiences that reward exploration and engagement
- Embrace abundance and texture over minimalist restraint
- Create cozy, intimate digital spaces that feel personal and welcoming
- Celebrate diversity through varied visual elements and inclusive imagery

**Color Philosophy:**
Dusty rose (#E8B4B8) as the nurturing primary, deep plum (#5D4E6D) for luxurious depth, and soft sage (#B8D4B8) for calming balance. This palette evokes sunset in a bedroom, velvet textures, and botanical intimacy. The emotional intent is comfort and abundance—"There's room for all of you here, and it's beautiful."

**Layout Paradigm:**
Layered card stacks with visible depth—overlapping sections, multiple z-index layers, content that peeks from behind other elements. Use generous padding (3-4rem) and create visual nesting with background shapes. Sections feel like pages in a journal, each with its own texture.

**Signature Elements:**
- Textured backgrounds (subtle noise, gradient meshes, soft patterns)
- Layered cards with multiple shadows (0 4px 6px, 0 10px 20px at different opacities)
- Decorative flourishes (botanical illustrations, abstract shapes, hand-drawn elements)
- Soft-edged imagery with rounded corners (1.5rem) and subtle borders

**Interaction Philosophy:**
Interactions should feel luxurious and rewarding—smooth, slightly slow transitions (400-500ms) that let users savor the change. Hover states lift elements with shadow increases, clicks create ripple effects, form inputs have gentle focus glows. Every interaction whispers "Take your time."

**Animation:**
Lush, layered animations with staggered timing—elements fade in sequentially (100ms delays), parallax scrolling on background layers, calculator inputs have gentle bounce validation. Use ease-out curves (cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)) for smooth deceleration. Page loads reveal content in waves.

**Typography System:**
- Display: Cormorant Garamond (serif, 600/700 weights) for headlines—elegant, literary, intimate
- Body: Nunito (sans-serif, 400/600 weights) for friendly readability
- Hierarchy: 3.75rem/2.25rem/1.375rem/1rem with 1.7 line-height for luxurious spacing
- This pairing balances classical elegance with contemporary warmth and approachability
